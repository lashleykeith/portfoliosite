# portfoliosite
This is portfolio site that I will update continually.
## Contents
This contains the following projects:
addressbook, weathertracker, weatherapp, social media blog and zip-coder finder.  More will be posted soon.

## Image modifier apps
In order to help you manage your images I have included the images folder.  Simply go to the images folder
and write python script.py.  This will re-format the files according to the dimensions. You can format this file
to match your photos designs by going to line 8 in the python script and changing the image to match that
of the image with the main.css file in line 190 and 191.
